# JavaGraph
Java implementation of a graph

This graph was originally developed as part of a coding assignment I did to get the job at Panduit.  For fun, I cleaned it up and reworked it.  

It is a directed graph and implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path/distance.  As an excercise, I used Spring IOC to inject the shortest path alogrithm.

There is no UI to this, but there are unit tests and a 'MainDemo' java file to be run to demonstrate the functionality.
